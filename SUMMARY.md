## GH issue #10 — Phase 3c: tracking:snapshot command

### What changed

- `app/Console/Commands/Spendula/TrackingSnapshotCommand.php` — Phase-1
  stub replaced with the full snapshot implementation. Walks every
  active tracking-mapped `bank_account` (or the single one passed via
  `--account=<spendula-uuid>`), fetches the live native-currency
  balance via `EnableBanking\Client::accountBalances`, picks the most
  comparable balance type (`interim_available` → `expected` → first),
  converts to EUR via `RateProvider::getRate(...)` using
  `bcmul(..., 0)` truncation at the milliunit boundary, fetches the
  current YNAB balance via `Ynab\Client::account`, computes the
  delta, and pushes a single `Balance Adjustment` transaction
  (`cleared='reconciled'`, `approved=true`) per account. Records a
  `tracking_snapshots` row per pushed delta. `--dry-run` skips both
  side effects but performs the same lookups so operators can preview
  deltas. Wraps the whole run in
  `AdvisoryLock::withLock(AdvisoryLock::TRACKING_SNAPSHOT, …)`.
- `app/Services/Ynab/Client.php` — new `account(string $ynabAccountId):
  array` method; mirrors the existing retry/classification scaffolding
  via `requestJson('GET', "/plans/{plan_id}/accounts/{id}")`.
- `app/Services/EnableBanking/Client.php` — new `accountBalances(string
  $uid): array` method; mirrors `accountTransactions` (idempotent GET,
  5xx retry ladder, typed exceptions).
- `app/Console/Commands/Spendula/DECISIONS.md` — **new file**. Five
  decisions: (1) v1 ships EB-balances path only, fallback deferred;
  (2) idempotency is operator-driven cadence; (3) `interim_available`
  → `expected` → first-entry as picked-balance fallback chain;
  (4) `cleared='reconciled'` + `approved=true` are SPEC-mandated and
  inline (no `PayloadBuilder` reuse); (5) `--account` takes the
  Spendula UUID, not YNAB's.
- `tests/Feature/Commands/Spendula/TrackingSnapshotCommandTest.php` —
  **new file**, 10 tests: happy path (payload + snapshot row),
  `--dry-run`, `--account` scope, invalid UUID, non-tracking-account
  rejection, same-day idempotency (delta-zero on second run), advisory
  lock contention (via second PDO connection — Postgres advisory locks
  are per-session), rate-provider unreachable abort, per-account EB
  isolation (one fails, one succeeds → exit 0), all-EB-fail abort.
- `tests/Feature/Services/Ynab/ClientAccountTest.php` — **new file**,
  4 tests: path correctness + envelope auto-unwrap, 401 → auth, 429 →
  rate-limit (after one retry), 5xx → server (after retries).
- `tests/Feature/Services/EnableBanking/ClientAccountBalancesTest.php`
  — **new file**, 5 tests: path + JWT bearer, 401, 403, 429, 5xx.
- `tests/Feature/Commands/Spendula/StubCommandsTest.php` — removed the
  `'spendula:tracking:snapshot'` entry; the stub no longer prints "not
  yet implemented".
- `docs/PLAN.md` — Phase 3c struck through `~~…~~ (done 2026-04-30)`,
  with a one-line note that the EB-balances-only fallback decision is
  recorded in `DECISIONS.md`.

### Assumptions made

- **Mock ASPSP behaviours.** The Mock ASPSP doesn't expose `/balances`
  realistically, so the integration-style tests stub the EB balances
  endpoint via `Http::fake`. Production EB returns a `balances[]`
  array with shape `{balance_type, balance_amount: {amount, currency},
  credit_debit_indicator}`; the test fixtures match that shape. The
  picked-balance preference order (`interim_available` → `expected` →
  first entry) is recorded in DECISIONS so any production-EB drift
  is observable through the structured log.
- **YNAB API responses are stubbed via `Http::fake`.** The
  `data.account.balance` field is an integer (EUR milliunits), since
  YNAB plans are single-currency per SPEC §5.3 and the YNAB API
  returns balances in the plan's currency. No live YNAB hit; pin
  against contract.
- **Rate-provider weekend rollback semantics persisted.** The memo's
  "as of {YYYY-MM-DD}" uses `$rate->rateDate` (the actually-published
  date), so a Sunday snapshot referencing a Friday rate has
  `memo = "...as of 2026-04-23"` while
  `tracking_snapshots.as_of_date = 2026-04-25` (the day the snapshot
  was taken). The `as_of_date` column captures snapshot-day, not
  rate-day. SPEC §5.3 was silent; pinned in DECISIONS.
- **Fallback path entirely deferred.** No `opening_balance` field
  exists in the schema today. Computing a balance by summing
  `transactions.amount_milliunits` from zero would produce a
  meaningless absolute number on the first run, but a self-consistent
  delta thereafter. Decision: ship EB-balances path only; file the
  fallback as `#TBD: tracking-snapshot fallback when EB balances
  unreachable` with the opening-balance schema decision attached.
- **Postgres session timezone was UTC** during the test run (default
  config). `pushed_at` and `as_of_date` round-trip correctly through
  `RefreshDatabase`. 164 / 164 tests pass; PHPStan level 8 clean;
  Pint clean.
- **Advisory lock test uses a second PDO connection.** Postgres
  advisory locks are per-session and re-entrant within the same
  session. The test process and the artisan command share the test's
  DB connection, so a same-session `tryAcquire` would succeed
  re-entrantly. The test opens a separate PDO and acquires from
  there to make the command's `tryAcquire` actually fail. Captures
  the LockBusyException-test-coverage gap previously flagged in
  observation #397.
- **Money math via `bcmul((string) $native_milliunits, $rate->rate, 0)`
  with `(int)` cast at the milliunit boundary.** `bcmul` with scale 0
  truncates toward zero (matching `Money::toMilliunits`'s direction).
  PHPStan required a runtime `is_numeric($rate->rate)` guard to
  satisfy `numeric-string` typing — rate provider already guarantees
  this; the guard surfaces a clear `RuntimeException` if a future
  provider regresses.
- **Per-account EB-failure isolation matches `PushRunner::pushGroup`.**
  Exit 0 if at least one account succeeded; exit 1 if all failed; exit
  1 unconditionally on rate-provider unreachable, YNAB auth, YNAB
  rate-limit, or lock contention. Documented in the command's class
  docblock.

### Blast radius

- **New side-effect surface.** Operators running
  `spendula:tracking:snapshot` will see one new YNAB transaction per
  active tracking account per run, plus one new `tracking_snapshots`
  row each. No changes to sync/review/push paths; the snapshot
  command is the only consumer of `status = tracking` rows alongside
  review/push (which filter them out structurally).
- **Two new client methods (`Ynab::account`,
  `EnableBanking::accountBalances`)** are public on shared
  singletons. Other commands could call them, but no other Phase 1–3
  code path does today. Adding new callers is fine; the methods
  reuse the existing retry ladders.
- **No schema changes.** `tracking_snapshots` table already existed
  from Phase 1; this issue is the first to write to it.
- **Existing tests untouched.** `StubCommandsTest` shrinks by one
  entry; everything else compiles and passes unchanged.

### Open threads

- **Transactions-sum fallback path** for when EB `/balances` is
  unreachable. Filed as `#TBD: tracking-snapshot fallback when EB
  balances unreachable`; needs an `opening_balance` schema decision
  attached.
- **`tracking_snapshots.eb_balance_type` column** to persist the
  picked balance type (currently logged only). Filed as a follow-up
  if operators want the audit trail visible in DB rather than only in
  the structured log.
- **Automatic snapshot cadence** is explicitly out of scope per SPEC
  §5.4 (manual in v1; no scheduler).
- **Per-snapshot rate-provider override** (not currently supported;
  always uses the configured provider). No demand today.
